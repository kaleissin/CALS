<h1>The Buck lists</h1>

<p>The Buck lists all started with the book <i>A dictionary of
    grammatical terms in linguistics</i> by <i>Carl Darling Buck</i>, published 
by <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo3630267.html">The
    University of Chicago Press</a> in 1949. The words in the book are
divided into 22 categories, and within each category each word, or
sense, has its own identifying symbol, the Buck number.</p>

<p>The Buck number consists of two groups of digits, the first group is
the category and the second is the id within that category. The groups
are usually separated by a dot ('.').</p>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_1949_list' %}">Buck 1949</a></dt>
    <dd>These are the words from the book itself. Buck numbers that
    originates from the book are prefixed with a 'b'. Because b13.31,
    b13.53, b14.72, b18.14, b19.352 and b19.71 aren't senses per se but
    overviews of several other senses, they are not included in this
    list.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_ids_list' %}">Buck IDS</a></dt>
    <dd>The Buck categories and words were later used as the basis for
    <a href="http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/ids/">The Intercontinental
        Dictionary Series (IDS)</a>. IDS only used a subset of the words
    from the book. However, some new words were added and others were
    given new Buck numbers. For instance, b4.48 "egg" in Buck is the same as
    i5.970 "egg" in IDS. Buck numbers from IDS are prefixed with an 'i'.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_wold_list' %}">Buck WOLD</a></dt>
    <dd>The IDS-list was then used as the basis for <a
        href="http://wold.clld.org/">the World Loanword
        Database (WOLD)</a>. WOLD also increased the number of senses
    and added two additional categories: <strong>23 Modern world</strong>
    and <strong>24 Miscellaneous function words</strong>. The purpose of 
    the list was to track the path of loan-words: which languages borrow
    which words from which other languages. Many of the added words are
    therefore highly culture-specific, so handle with care. Buck numbers
    from IDS are prefixed with a 'w'.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_common_list' %}">Minimum Buck</a></dt>
    <dd>Only the senses that all three Buck-lists have in common.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_list' %}">Maximum Buck</a></dt>
    <dd>Every sense from every Buck-list.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_only_1949_list' %}">Only words unique to Buck 1949</a></dt>
    <dd>They had a thing for castrated farm animals in the olden days.
    Notice also that the numeral three is used as a stand-in for things
    one can do with numbers.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_only_ids_list' %}">Only words unique to IDS</a></dt>
    <dd>Not a lot.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_only_wold_list' %}">Only words unique to WOLD</a></dt>
    <dd>This list also includes the extra categories <b>23 Modern world</b> 
    and <b>24 Miscellaneous function words</b>.</dd>

    <dt><a href="{% url 'buck_ids_wold_list' %}">The words added by IDS and WOLD</a></dt>
    <dd>Now complete.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A test for whether a word-list is based on Buck, IDS or WOLD is what
the Buck number is for "thief". In Buck, "thief" has the number 11.57
sorted under the category <strong>11 Possession</strong>, in IDS the
number is 21.520, sorting under <strong>21 Law</strong>, and in WOLD,
it has the number 21.52. Buck-format prefers a minimum of two digits after the
dot and never has more than three. WOLD-format can have more than three
digits after the dot. IDS and especially WOLD are keen on using zero in
the numbers.</p>

<h1>The Leipzig-Jakarta list</h1>
<p>The Leipzig-Jakarta list of 100 words aims to replace the Swadesh lists. It is calculated from the words and meanings in WOLD, but the wold number (the <b>LWT code</b>) has been stripped away and there are some oddities like <b>arm/hand</b> and <b>leg/foot</b>.</p>
