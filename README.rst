Now you are published, oh eater of my spare time!

Note on code quality
--------------------

Process to convert repo from svn started sometime during 2010. Results
of svn-workflow-bugaboos (like commit-to-test, branching-what-branching)
have been somewhat but not perfectly cleaned up, as exhaustion set in. 

Long live ``git rebase -i``, ``git add -p`` and ``git filter-branch``!
